    /*
    Write a program that can print the numbers between 1 ~ N that can be divisible by 3, 5, and 15.
            if the number can be divisible by 3, 5 and 15,
                then it should only be displayed in DivisibelBy15' section

            if the number can be divisible by 3 but cannot be divisible by 15,
                then it should only be displayed in DivisibelBy3' section

            if the number can be divisible by 5 but cannot be divisible by 15,
                then it should only be displayed in DivisibelBy5' section

        EX:
            input: 100

            Output:
                 Divisible By 15 15 30 45 60 75 90
                 Divisible By 5 5 10 20 25 35 40 50 55 65 70 80 85 95 100
                 Divisible By 3 3 6 9 12 18 21 24 27 33 36 39 42 48 51 54 57 63 66 69 72 78 81 84 87 93 96 99
